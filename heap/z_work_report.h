/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: entry struct that went through in class, because I'm
                not quite clear on the purpose and how to implement it.
        -Implemented: info struct in PQueue class, basic operator of it, and
                some simple function to maintain the structure.
        -Partly implemented: not that I know of

    Reflections:
        I'm super confused about this project, because I had to miss a day of
        class on Tuesday. Never have I ever imagine I would be so far behind
        due to missing one class, since I was behind already. The discussion 
        during Wed and Thur was not connection to the project that we are 
        supposed to work on. Anyway, I still kind of manage to get basic 
        structure going on, although I'm not quite sure this is the same as
        the discussion in class that you mentioned.
