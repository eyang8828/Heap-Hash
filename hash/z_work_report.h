/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: chained_hash was not done fully, many features were
                buggy
        -Implemented: open hash and double hash and both were able to run
                the same test.

    Reflections:
        Didn't get my list class done correctly, so I had a hard time doing the
            chained hash, hope that I can get more time to finish this fully. 
            And I'm hating myself for didn't get the list class finished correctly,
            which give me a hell lot of trouble.
